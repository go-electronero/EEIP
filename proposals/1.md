## WIP1: PoAwR consensus

In Go-Electronero under PoAwR consensus our DAO is a power battle for the block! 

PoAwR is short for Proof-of-Authority with Rebates. 

In PoA there are no block rewards. Through our research and development influenced by feedback from our exchange partners at Indoex.io we have worked hard on the PoAwR consensus contributions. The PoAwR consensus is our gift to community and is open source under MIT license. What is so useful about PoAwR is that PoAwR delivers a fixed block rebate to a predetermined public wallet address. The receiver of the rebates is known as RebateOracle, the proposed Governance token is ROCA which introduces a new standard "GT-IP1". The ROCA is an inherited quality of PoAwR in order to preserve decentralization. In other words, anyone could own the DAO and claim block rebate (rewards) for their party at any given point in time through a public decentralized voting protocol known as ROCA. Through ROCA anyone may vote towards nominating a public wallet to become an authorized party. Voters can only vote once per voting period, and can not cast votes for the self. Authorized parties are granted governance token, and have a lot of power over the DAO. 

This is remarkable, PoAwR an all new consensus algorithm bringing an all new immutable game of power and battle for the blockchain! Our first draft RebateOracle contract is neat, what it does is very important to PoAwR consensus. We are continuing this research, and expect to be complete this week. PoAwR builds upon the PoA consensus in a manner which introduces block rebates as a fixed reward per block. It was decided the receiver of all rewards must be an immutable smart contract owned by the blockchain, and it should be deployed at genesis. This is how we have engineered this case with the Certificate of Authority, enabling public voting for nominations of authorized parties and power battles  for the DAO between authorized parties..
New xAsset under R&D @ electronero network: Rebate Oracle and Governance (GT-IP1) published to Github (first look)

 2 part design: 
 -> CA (certificate of authority) deployyed on genesis (https://github.com/crystaleum/rebate-oracle/blob/main/RebateOracle.sol)
 -> DAO (decentralized autonomous organization)
 CA is immutable, deployed on genesis.
 DAO is voted on by authorized parties who they themselves are nominated by the public through the ROCA.

Bytecode to be deployed on Go-Electronero at genesis. 
Rebate Oracle and Governance acts as the Certificate of Authority of the internal PoAwR consensus; 
PoAwR is built on top of the underlying PoA (proof-of-authority) consensus. 
Marking a new discovery published, adding a block rebate to a PoA chaain brings the question... 
Where do the rebates go? How do we maintain decentralization?
Well that was how we came about to engineer the Rebate Oracle as the decentralized receiver of rebates, guardian of the native alt-ether coins emitted into the contract, the governance mechanisms are in place acting as a poll for voters to publicly nominate authorized parties. 
Of which authorized parties have the access to cast their votes on new DAO implementations, and other settings. 

PoAwR consensus seems to be by far our most wildest creations yet and we put our best foot forward with each contribution. This PoAwR consensus is paving the way for the future of private alt-ethereum chains. Utilizing decentralized Rebate Oracle, along with it's internal GT-IP1 Governance built upon ERC20 standards, this is a milestone for our research and development into the alt-ethereum space. 

We hope you enjoy! Stay tuned for more R&D!
Some feedback and edits:
- withdraw need a lower or adjustable amount, could be another voting topic
- voting cost may be adjusted or adjustable, this would adjust value of governance token
- voting cost should increment, not to exceed limits based on percentages of totalSupply 
- the DAO can be voted on in a decentralized manner, this contract creates a multi-tiered governance open to the public. 
- voting periods (to block bots from making too many votes too fast etc)
- the DAO should also be locked for some period of blocks

functionality: 
launch() will vote the deployer as the first authorized, and nominate a CA (which is the DAO implementation to receive coin withdrawals)

authorizeParty() internal function runs when the public nominations poll reaches the cap, i.e when a user gets nominated and receives enough votes then they will become "authorized"
authorized parties receive 1/7 of the total Governance token supply *(used to vote on DAO implementations, and propose new nominees for authorized parties)

nominateAuthorized() is a public function anyone may vote, can not vote twice (during poll period) and can not vote for self, if there is enough luck see getDAOLuck then the nominee becomes authorized (granted)
votes costs 1/7 of the balanceOf(governanceToken)

nominateCA() is for "authorized" parties to nominate a new DAO, we could set more logic in place to hold the DAO for a length of time such as 4 years or annual elections periods

withdrawToDAO() is where "authorized" parties can trigger withdraw all coins from CA to DAO. This function also costs 1/7 of the users Governance token to initiate.

A few more commits and this is a whole new game of power battles for the DAO good for Go-Electronero, while Crystaleum remains strict PoA

Additional restrictions in discussions for public voting functions on RebateOracle
= restrict calls to onlyToken (a custom modifier)
= onlyToken checks and enforces calls by specific contract address, same as onlyOwner for contract address
= make all restricted functions external
= write an interface for RebateOracle "IROC22"
= draft another contract for authorized parties to be known as "BoardRoom" which public functions only communicate with RebateOracle via IROC22
= draft another contract for voters to be known as "BallotBox" which public functions only communicate with RebateOracle via IROC22
= restrict all calls onlyToken and relieve public calls to RebateOracle
= all public calls to RebateOracle must be made through the BoardRoom or BallotBox
